# Encoded_Audit

A Little program used to manage everyday expense.
Version 1 just can be used to record the expense.
The audit is encode by DES, MD5, so you don't need to worry about the security.

**NOTE**:There is a bug which have not been solved yet. If you want to recompile the program, you need to backup your audit(cipher text) first, or the cipher_text will be lost.
